# Add and open an app in Microsoft Teams
Add an app to a Microsoft Teams channel so that anybody with whom the app was shared can open it from within that channel. You can add any app that you built or for which you have **Can use** or **Can edit** permissions, and you can both add and open the app from a browser or the desktop app for Microsoft Teams.

## Add an app ##
1. [Share the app](share-app.md) with other members of the team.

1. In Microsoft Teams, select a team and a channel for that team.

## Known issues ##
In the desktop app for Microsoft Teams:

- Apps must load content such as images and .pdf files over a secure (https) connection.
- Not all sensors, such as **Acceleration**, **Compass**, and **Location**, are supported.
- Only these audio formats are supported: AAC, H264, OGG Vorbis, and WAV.
