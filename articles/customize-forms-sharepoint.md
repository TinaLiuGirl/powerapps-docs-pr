# Customize forms in PowerApps #
Customize a **Display form** control and an **Edit form** control so that they show the data that matters most, in the most intuitive order, and in the controls that help users easily understand and update the data.

Each form comprises one or more cards, each of which shows data from a particular column in the data source. By following the steps in this topic, you can specify which cards appear in a form, move cards up and down within a form, and configure how data from each column appears within a card.

If you're unfamiliar with PowerApps, see [Introduction to PowerApps](getting-started.md).
