# Overview of the PowerApps mobile player

In this topic, we'll look an overview of the PowerApps mobile player. The mobile player is available for the iOS, Android, and Windows mobile devices. Fortunately, you only have to create one app, and the mobile player makes sure that your users can run the app on multiple devices.

## Getting started

To get started, download the player from the app store for your device. The iOS and Android stores are shown here.

When you first login, you will see a list of sample apps that have been provided by Microsoft.  These apps are made available for you to try out and play with in advance.  Letâ€™s look at the **Asset Checkout** app. Tap **Asset Checkout** and then tap **Got it**.

The **Asset Checkout** app is useful for organizations with users that need to borrow equiptment for offsite visits, such as customer engagements. This app allows them to select the equipment they need and reserve it.  Click on **Mice**.

You can customize this app for your own organization using the **Asset Checkout** template from the PowerApps home page.

Close the app and return to the list of apps. If you like the **Asset Checkout** app, you can tap on the 3-dot menu and pin it to your home page, or you can mark it as **Favorite** from the PowerApps dropdown list.

Close the mobile player by using the same method that you would with any other app on your device. You can also sign out of the player by clicking the upper left menu and selecting **Sign out**.
