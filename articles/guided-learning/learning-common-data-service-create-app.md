# Creating an application with the Common Data Service

In previous topics, we talked about a **common data model**. The common data model stores what we call **entities**. What are entities? Entities can be thought of as **shared data**, which can be stored, retrieved, modified, and interacted with.  In this topic, youâ€™ll learn more about entities and how to use them when you create an app. 


## Entities
There are two types of entities: **standard entities**, which are provided with the PowerApps product, and **custom entities**, which you can create to meet your specific data needs.

To view the standard entities, open PowerApps, click **Common Data Service**, and then click **Entities**. Shown below are some of the standard entities that ship out of the box, and are available to use immediately.

Entities are grouped by **categories**, which are based on the functions that they serve. When you are building an app, you will often use entities from the same group.

## Parts of an entity

Entities contain a set of default **fields**, or attributes. For example, the **Product** entity has seven fields, shown below.

Fields are also grouped into **Field groups**, which control the entities and data that display when you build an application.

Entity **keys** identify a unique row in an entity,

and **relationships** create connections between related entities.

The **Data** tab will display the sample data provided with PowerApps, or your own data that you have imported.

## Create an application 


In PowerApps, click **New app**.

Click **Phone layout** for the **Common Data Service** app. 

![CDS-phone-layout](./media/learning-common-data-service-create-app/cds-phone-layout.png)

The Common Data Service connection is already selected.  In the right-hand pane, scroll down or search for **Products**, select it, and then click **Connect**.

PowerApps will automatically build the app and open in the PowerApps Web Studio.

The application is automatically ready to use. You can save this application as-is without changing anything, and then share it to your users, who can access it on their Android and iOS devices using the PowerApps app from the AppStore. 

In the next video, we'll look at how to create a custom entity.
