**NOTES**

- *If you need more time to evaluate PowerApps, you can request to extend your trial period for 90 more days*.
- *Users who take advantage of this in-product PowerApps trial do not appear in the Office 365 admin portal as PowerApps Plan 2 trial users (unless they have another license to Office 365, Dynamics 365, or PowerApps)*.
- *If you are an IT administrator who wants to acquire and deploy PowerApps trial licenses to multiple users in your organization without requiring individual users to accept terms, you can sign up for a [PowerApps Plan 2 subscription trial][6]. You will need to be an Office 365 Global or Billing Admin or create a new tenant to sign up for an admin trial*.  [Learn more](signup-for-powerapps-admin.md)

## Individual signup has been turned off ##
When trying to sign up for PowerApps, you may encounter the following message.

> Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft PowerApps.

![](./media/signup-for-powerapps/Individual-sign-up-turned-off.png)

This could be because your organization has disabled signups for individuals. It could also be because you purchased Office 365 through a partner. Learn more.

If your organization has disabled signups for individuals, work with your IT group to get a PowerApps license assigned to your account.

## Troubleshoot ##
In many cases, you can sign up for PowerApps by following the steps in this topic. However, signup may fail because of any of several reasons. The following table summarizes some of the most common reasons and ways you can work around these issues.

| Symptom / Error Message |Cause and Workaround|
|---|---|
| **Personal email addresses (e.g. nancy@gmail.com)** <br> <br> You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `You entered a personal email address: Please enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data.` <br> <br> or <br> <br> `That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.`| PowerApps does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. <br> <br> To complete signup, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school.|
| ** .gov or .mil addresses ** <br> <br> You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `PowerApps unavailable: PowerApps is not available for users with .gov or .mil email addresses at this time. Use another work email address or check back later.` <br> <br> or <br> <br> `We can't finish signing you up. It looks like Microsoft PowerApps isn't currently available for your work or school.` | PowerApps does not support .gov or .mil addresses at this time.|
| **Self-service signup disabled** <br> <br> You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft PowerApps. Contact them to complete signup.` <br> <br> or <br> <br> `That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.` | Your organization’s IT administrator has disabled self-service signup for PowerApps. <br> <br> To complete signup, contact your IT administrator and ask them to allow users to sign up for PowerApps and to allow new users to join your existing tenant.|
| **Email address is not an Office 365 ID** <br> <br>  You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `We can't find you at contoso.com.  Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with that, and if it doesn't work, contact your IT department.` | Your organization signs in to Office 365 and other Microsoft services with IDs other than email addresses. For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com, but your ID is nancys@contoso.com. <br> <br> To complete signup, use the ID that your organization has assigned to you for signing in to Office 365 or other Microsoft services.  If you don't know what this is, contact your IT administrator. |
