# Overview of connectors for PowerApps #
Data is at the core of most apps, including those you build in PowerApps. Data is stored in a *data source*, and you bring that data into your app by creating a *connection*. The connection uses a specific *connector* to talk to the data source. PowerApps has connectors for many popular services and on-premises data sources, including SharePoint, SQL Server, Office 365, Salesforce, Twitter, and more. To get started adding data to an app, see [Add a data connection in PowerApps](add-data-connection.md).

The following table has links to more information about our most popular connectors. For a full list of connectors, see the [Microsoft Connector Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/).

If you have questions about a specific connector, please use the [PowerApps Forums](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/PowerApps-Community/ct-p/PowerApps1). If you have an idea for a new connector or suggestions for improvement, use [PowerApps Ideas](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/PowerApps-Ideas/idb-p/PowerAppsIdeas). 

## Types of connectors
PowerApps has two types of connectors: *standard connectors* like the ones listed above, and *custom connectors*. If you're connecting to a data source that PowerApps supports with a standard connector, use that connector. If you need to connect to another source, like a service that you've built, see [Register and use custom connectors](register-custom-api.md).

Standard connectors behave differently depending on the type of data source they connect to and how data is returned by that data source:

- Some connectors work with tabular data sources, such as SharePoint, SQL Server, and Excel. When working with these data sources, data is returned to PowerApps as a table. PowerApps uses its own functions, such as [Patch()](functions/function-patch.md), [Collect()](functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md), [Update()](functions/function-update-updateif.md), and so on to interact with the data. Tabular data is also easy to use in forms and galleries, where a field in a table is displayed as a field in a gallery or form. For more information, see the following articles:

    [Understand data sources in PowerApps](working-with-data-sources.md)

    [Generate an app from Excel data](get-started-create-from-data.md)

    [Create an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md)

    **Note:** To connect to data in Excel, the workbook must be hosted in a cloud-storage service like OneDrive. For more information, see [Connect to cloud-storage from PowerApps](./connections/cloud-storage-blob-connections.md).

- Other connectors work with function-based data sources, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Office 365 Outlook. When working with these data sources, data is returned to PowerApps based on calling specific functions in the underlying service. For example, with the Twitter connector you call `Twitter.MyFollowers()` to return a list of your followers. You can still use this data in a form or gallery, but it requires a little more work than tabular data. For more information, see [Connect to Twitter from PowerApps](connections/connection-twitter.md).
