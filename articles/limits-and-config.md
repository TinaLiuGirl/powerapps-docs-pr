# Limits and configuration in Microsoft PowerApps
This topic contains information about the current limits and configuration details for PowerApps.

## Requests ##
These limits apply to each single outgoing request:

|Name|Limit|
|----|----|
|Timeout|180 Seconds|
|Retry attempts|4|

**NOTE**: The retry value may vary. For certain error conditions, it doesn't make sense to retry.

## IP addresses ##
Requests from PowerApps use IP addresses that depend on the region of the [environment](environments-overview.md) that the app is in. We don't publish fully qualified domain names available for PowerApps scenarios.

Calls made from an API connected through an app (for example, the SQL API or the SharePoint API) come from the IP address specified later in this topic.

You should use these addresses if, for example, you must whitelist IP addresses for an Azure SQL database.
