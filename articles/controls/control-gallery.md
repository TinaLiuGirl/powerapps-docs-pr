# Gallery control in PowerApps #
A control that contains other controls and shows a set of data.

## Description ##
A **Gallery** control can show multiple records from a data source, and each record can contain multiple types of data. For example, a **Gallery** control can show multiple contacts with each item showing contact information that includes a name, an address, and a phone number for each contact. Each data field appears in a separate control within the **Gallery** control, and you can configure those controls in its template. The template appears as the first item inside the gallery, on the left edge of a **Gallery** control in horizontal/landscape orientation and at the top of a **Gallery** control in vertical/portrait orientation. Any changes that you make in the template are reflected throughout the **Gallery** control.

Predefined Gallery templates for showing images, text as well as a gallery with variable height items are available.

## Key properties ##
