# Camera control in PowerApps #
A control with which the user can take photos by using the camera on the device.

## Description ##
If you add this control, the user can update a data source with one or more photos from wherever the app is running.

## Key properties ##

**Camera** – On a device that has more than one camera, the numeric ID of the camera that the app uses.

## Additional properties ##

**[BorderColor](properties-color-border.md)** – The color of a control's border.

**[BorderStyle](properties-color-border.md)** – Whether a control's border is **Solid**, **Dashed**, **Dotted**, or **None**.

**[BorderThickness](properties-color-border.md)** – The thickness of a control's border.

**Brightness** – How much light the user is likely to perceive in an image.

**Contrast** – How easily the user can distinguish between similar colors in an image.

**[DisplayMode](properties-core.md)** – Whether the control allows user input (**Edit**), only displays data (**View**), or is disabled (**Disabled**).

**[Height](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's top and bottom edges.

**[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** – How the app responds when the user taps or clicks a control.

**OnStream** – How the app responds when the **Stream** property is updated.

**Photo** – The image captured  when the user takes a picture.

**Stream** – Automatically updated image based on the **StreamRate** property.

**StreamRate** – How often to update the image on the **Stream** property, in milliseconds.  This value can range from 100 (1/10th of a second) to 3,600,000 (1 hour).

**[Tooltip](properties-core.md)** – Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over a control.

**[Visible](properties-core.md)** – Whether a control appears or is hidden.

**[Width](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between a control's left and right edges.

**[X](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the left edge of a control and the left edge of its parent container (screen if no parent container).

**[Y](properties-size-location.md)** – The distance between the top edge of a control and the top edge of the parent container (screen if no parent container).

**Zoom** – The percentage by which an image from a camera is magnified or the view of a file in a PDF viewer.

## Example ##
### Add photos to an Image gallery control ###
1. Add a **Camera** control, name it **MyCamera**, and set its **[OnSelect](properties-core.md)** property to this formula:<br>
**Collect(MyPix, MyCamera.Photo)**

	Don't know how to [add, name, and configure a control](../add-configure-controls.md)?

	Want more information about the **[Collect](../functions/function-clear-collect-clearcollect.md)** function or [other functions](../formula-reference.md)?

1. Press F5, and then take a photo by clicking or tapping **MyCamera**.

1. Add an **[Image gallery](control-gallery.md)** control, and then resize its **[Image](control-image.md)** control, its template, and the **Image gallery** control itself to fit in the screen.

1. Set the **[Items](properties-core.md)** property of the **Image gallery** control to this expression:<br>**MyPix.Url**.

1. Set the **[Image](properties-visual.md)** property of the **Image** control in the gallery to this expression:<br>
**ThisItem.Url**

	The photo that you took appears in the **Image gallery** control.

1. Take as many photos as you want, and then return to the default workspace by pressing Esc.

1. (optional) Set the **OnSelect** property of the **Image** control in the **Image gallery** control to **Remove(MyPix, ThisItem)**, press F5, and then click or tap a photo to remove it.

Use the **[SaveData](../functions/function-savedata-loaddata.md)** function to save the photos locally or the **[Patch](../functions/function-patch.md)** function to update a data source.
