# View analytics reports for your app #
Have you built an app and shared it out to your organization?  Are you curious how many of your colleagues are using it on a daily basis?

Introducing the first  PowerApps analytics report that is now available in preview from [web.powerapps.com](1); the **App usage report**.

The App usage report gives you the ability to track how many users are using your app over the past 30 days broken down by day, device platform and location.

## How do I get access to my app's reports? ##
All reports are available to any user with "Can edit" permission to the app, but the user must have a PowerApps Plan 2 or PowerApps Plan 2 trial license in order to access the report.

*NOTE: While analytics reports are in preview, any user with a valid PowerApps license will be able to access and try out the report*
